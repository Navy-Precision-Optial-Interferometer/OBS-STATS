# OBS-STATS

Current To-Do List:

1. Quality assurance/"edge cases" check for the by-way stats
2. Include seeing information (scrape or just do by hand? Need to decide)
3. Scheduled nights vs. actual nights per Jason, average nights per week, etc.
4. Quality assurance on average scans per hour (think about how to do this)
